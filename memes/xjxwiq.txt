Doofenshmirtz is a bad villain
but a great dad
Doofenshmirtz does all of his evil
schemes to vent, expressing his suffering
and tragic history to Perry the Platypus,
the only one in his life who actually
listens, making peace with his past so
that he gives his daughter everything he
never had, breaking the cycle of abuse
and neglect and making him the greatest
father of all time.
