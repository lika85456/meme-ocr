My wife of 33 years was diagnosed with leukaemia. She
wanted to use the time she had left to "create memories".
Which she did.
She gave the grandkids the time of their lives.
The last time we went out when she was well was when we
took the motorbike for a ride to the nearby coast. We had
stopped to buy fish and chips and went on to the cliff tops.
Sitting in the tall native grass looking out to sea, we
suddenly saw a pod of Orcas swimming up the coast close
to the shore. This isnt unusual, as it is their route from
Antartica north.
But there was more than one pod. There would have been
close to fifty or sixty whales spread out over four or five
miles.
It was an awesome sight.
On the way home, on a longish straight, I opened the bike up
and rode quite quickly. As I slowed for a corner I expected
the usual jab in the ribs for speeding. I called out an apology
and she rep[lied, "Ive got cancer Dave, fuckin thrill me".
Permission granted, I gave her the ride of a lifetime.
She died shortly after that./ but what a damned good
memory.
