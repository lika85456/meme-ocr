Heads up North Carolina:
About a year ago my daughter came home wearing a button that said "I'I
go with you." I asked her what it meant, and she explained that there were
transgender children at her high-school, and many of them were
uncomfortable using the assigned restrooms. The button is an indication
that she (and some of her fellow brave, badass friends) is willing to
accompany you to the bathroom if you're in that situation.
Sometimes I forget that our children can teach us lessons. My
reminded me that you don't have to be big and scary looking to be a
badass brand of brave.
Next week I'm going to North Carolina, the land of bathroom law hijinks, for
work. And I'm stealing her button. I can't be everywhere, but if I'm around
you're safe.
