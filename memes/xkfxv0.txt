Dear Animals,
Just to explain the enclosed blankets are not too well
made but the reason for this is that my Mother-in-Law
who was partially blind and 97 years old insisted that
she made the squares to help keep you all warm and
have something soft to lay on.
If they are not good enough then use as you feel fit.
Thank You.
