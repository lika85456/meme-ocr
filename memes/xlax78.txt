This happened to my friend. He had just moved into a
high rise in Miami and got drunk, went to sleep in the
apartment one floor below his. He's a 20 something white
guy, woke up on "his" couch to a 80 year old black woman
who had thrown a blanket over him and was making
him waffles. He had breakfast with her and they stayed
in touch. She passed a few years back and he flew from
Cleveland to Miami for the funeral.
