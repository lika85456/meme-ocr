Q
Replying to @SFPDTenderloin
I'm now in recovery. I have nearly 8
months clean and sober. I wanted to give
a big thank you to the Salvation Army
ARC for giving me a chance to get my life
back together and special thanks to
Officer Gilson of the TL Taskforce for
pulling me out of there. You saved my life.
