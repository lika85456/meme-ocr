# 18
answer.
Wow #18 was
tough, but I think I
got it
Alright, bring your

Ah, I see the error! It's a
common mistake. You have to
take the negative inverted sine to the first
prime number that begins with the fourth
fricative of the international phonetic
alphabet. Then divide by 64 and you get
the answer of 30456.4521 instead of 7.
