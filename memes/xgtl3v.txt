You
have a
broken
light!
It must have
just happened
I told you
about it two
weeks ago!
FOR F*CK'S SAKE,
DARLING, CAN'T YOU
KEEP THAT GOB OF
YOURS SHUT?
And your
license Impossible
has
expired.
Does your
husband
always talk
to you like
that?
Don't you
remember
getting the
letter last
month?
Only
when he's
drunk!
