1909
1977
Though I may 1919
currently be
poor, I must
work hard so
my kids can
have a better
future!
I miss grandma..
But life goes on,
and I want to
start a family of
my own! And
experiment with
new hairstyles
that feel more
"me".
2022
I really like your hair bro,
did you dye it pink like
grandma always wanted to
dye hers?
I've finally
managed to
buy a house for
my family! I
wonder what
my grandkids
will be up to
when they're
my age..
Our family
history is so
rich!
