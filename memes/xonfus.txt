A friend of mine has problems with paying his
bills. His parents don't support him that much
and he can't get a good student loan because of
stupid regulations. He often containers food at a
local super market and then invites me to dinner
and to hang out. He is about to get his bachelor
degree, and has to be in lab almost all day, thus
he cannot work more than a few hours a week. I
sometimes leave behind 5-20€ randomly lying
around in his room to support him. He wouldn't
take the money if I gave it to him directly.
edit: Puh, I'm glad my highest rated comment is
something I can be proud of.
