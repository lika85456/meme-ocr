My brother just
started his first
year of college,
it's my last year
He made new
friends, learned
his way around
campus, and he
stops following
me
HE MADE NEW
FRIENDS AND
LEARNED HIS WAY
AROUND CAMPUS
I tease him,
calling him a little
duckling for
following me
around
everywhere
...he stopped
following me...
