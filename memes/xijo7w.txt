Bro please come to the
pumpkin patch with me.
We'll drive 45 minutes
outside of town to a
farm where we have to
struggle up a muddy hill
just to park. There will
be screaming kids
everywhere and
aggressive farm
animals that aren't used
to all the people around,
bro. We can pay $30 for
a pumpkin rather than
buying one for $8 at the
store, plz bro.
