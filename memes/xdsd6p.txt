For Sale:
My White Privilege Card. Over
50 years old but in mint
condition. Never been used.
Reason for selling: It hasn't
done any thing for me! No free
college, no free food, no free
housing, no free anything. I've
had to go to work every day of
my life while paying a boatload
of taxes to carry those who
chose not to work!
If interested, I prefer cash but
willing to do an even trade for a
Victim Card which seems much
more widely accepted and
comes with countless benefits
