What do you think about
green?
Nah, I'm not
a huge fan
It really doesn't work! It does, why don't
It's so bland
you like it?
Nah, I don't
like it
What do
you think
about
white?
How about a gradient
from orange-brown to
white?
Does blue work for you
then?
You know what, living
together is not going to
work out
I still prefer
white
ARE YOU BREAKING UP
WITH ME?!
