Elly frowns at everything.
Oh my god that cloud has
become sentient it's
gonna kill us all!
I'll save you by popping
the balloons. The bike
will break your fall but
the impact will destroy it
Tie balloons on that kids
bike! We'll deliver him to
the cloud as sacrifice.

My bike is trashed and my eye
is messed up, but I'm glad I
wasn't eaten by that cloud
DUMP
