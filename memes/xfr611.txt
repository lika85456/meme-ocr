I OPPOSE THE
CARTOONIST
I AM NEUROTIC AND
TOTALLY ILLOGICAL
I AM
INCOMPREHENSIBLE
IN MY RAGE. MY SIZE
IS RELATIVE TO MY
ANGER
I represent the
cartoonist.
I am smart
You are
silly.
WHAT
I composedly
state my
views. They
are correct
YOU HAVE
OBVIOUSLY
WON.
√è
I DISAGREE
WITH YOU.
MY HEAD IS
MASSIVE.
I calmly
refute any
points you may
have made in
your lunacy
I AM SILLY!
