Acceptance Speeches That
Deserve Their Own Award Trophy
R
This is new for me, as things go. Normally I'm the
guy at the podium that hands these things out.
And I got pretty good at it, it's left-hand hold,
right-hand shake.
Apart from being a part of some pretty impressive, talented,
ensemble casts. I think that the last time that I waited to
hear my name called aloud to receive an award...
Was in grade four. And it was from
the Pee Wee Bowling League.
