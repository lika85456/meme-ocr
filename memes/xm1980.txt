shout out to the literal fan fiction happening a few blocks from my
apartment. there has been this halal meat market on the corner for
like 19 years that the owner's son just inherited and directly across
the street this woman opened a kosher grocery store and since day
one they've had this very friendly fake rivalry, playing it up for the
customers, it's always been super goofy and light hearted. so turns
out last night she proposed in the middle of the afternoon rush in the
meat market and he said YES and she's moving her store to the
adjacent empty storefront on the left so they can have a JOINT
GROCERY STORE it is so fucking cute I wish them the happiest
marriage ever
