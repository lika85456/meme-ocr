JOKE OF THE DAY
3 drunk guys enterd a taxi.
The taxi driver knew that they were drunk so he
started the engine & turned it off again. Then
said, "We have reached your destination". The
1st guy gave him money & the 2nd guy said
"Thank you". The 3rd guy slapped the driver.
The driver was shocked thinking the 3rd drunk
knew what he did. But then he asked "What was
that for?". The 3rd guy replied, "Control your
speed next time, you nearly killed us!"
