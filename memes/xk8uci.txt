Hi! I have Muscular Dystrophy and can't
straighten my arms. Can you make me look
normal in my homecoming picture?
Thanks!!!!

Acceptance of your true self can be a
constant battle. The term 'normal' is a
propaganda technique used by the modern
society to make us conform to a pre-existing
standard.
If people can't look past your physical
condition, they are most likely not worth your
attention. A pretty young girl with a genuine
smile and beautiful hair is all I see in this
picture.
