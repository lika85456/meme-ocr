Husband took dryer in for repair... 3 weeks ago...they can't find it. No record of it... husband went up and
found it outside in the middle of a bunch of others. Still no response from them. Avoid these rip offs.

Hi
1. Your husband dropped this unit off May 14, 2022, that is over 4 months ago. Certainly not 3 weeks.
2. We repeatedly called your husband to come pick it up, and he profusely apologized for having left it
with us for so long, and said that he would come pick it up as soon as possible.
3. Once an item is fixed, we call the customer, if they don't come pick it up within a reasonable time
frame, it gets moved out into the bay with the rest of the items.
4. We are not a storage unit for your divorce proceedings.
