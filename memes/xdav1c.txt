Amazing!
Everyone's age today is 2022
Did you know that today the whole
world is of the same age! Today is
a very special day and only happens
once every thousand (1,000) years.
Your age + your year of birth, every
person = 2022.
It's so strange that even experts can't
explain it! You check it out and see
if it's 2022. It has been waiting for a
thousand years!
Example:
I am 68 years old.
I was born in 1954.
So 68+1954= 2022
