When I was a kid I used to always twist the
quarter machines on the way into stores just in
case. Got lucky a couple of times and a few free
toys. Now that I'm grown if I'm leaving a store
with them I like to drop change into them if I have
it and leave them half twisted.
Thanks for the gold friend, it's like the adult
version of getting a free sticky hand egg! :D

I used to think that people just forgot their
quarters but as I age it's things like this that
just keep me happy. Thanks for helping out
some poor kids and kids in general.
