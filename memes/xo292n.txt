i used to get self-conscious over the smallest
things but friends let me tell you that today i had
to smuggle a furious 8ft python onto the bus
during the school rush and not a single person
noticed. not one. if people don't care enough to
notice a shopping bag writhing and seething
with barely-contained reptilian hatred then i
promise you that no-one will pay any attention to
that blemish you're fretting about or how you've
done your hair

this is extremely concerning and also very
reassuring, thank you and please stop bringing
pythons onto public transportation
