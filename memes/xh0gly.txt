Holy shit, it's Donkey
from the hit movie
Shrek.
Hey, we should join
forces and make
some good money
from a remake.

Please leave me
alone.
You know i

mad Shrek
impression.

You need some
serious help, dude.
I was even supposed
to play Shrek before
they gave the role to
Chris Farley and then
Mike Myers.
The killer from
Haloween
franchise?
