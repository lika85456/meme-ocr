Robin Williams was one of the first people to visit
Christopher Reeves in the hospital after the horse
riding accident that left him paralyzed. He came in
dressed as a doctor with a thick accent and told
Reeves he was there to give him a rectal exam,
causing him to laugh for the first time since the
accident.
