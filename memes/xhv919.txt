WE ARE NOT "BORN TO DIE", DOES A BOOK
BEGIN JUST TO FINISH? DOES A SONG OPEN
WITH A BEAUTIFUL CHORD PURELY TO END?
YES, WE ARE BORN WITH THE INEVITABLE FATE OF
DEATH, BUT THAT IS MERELY THE FINAL ACT OF THE
PLAY. WE ARE BORN TO LOVE, BE JOYOUS, TO MOVE,
LEARN, CRY, AND FEEL. WE ARE IN FACT BORN TO LIVE.
