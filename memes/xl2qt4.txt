Met an elderly hispanic lady at a bus stop in
Albuquerque. We went back and forth in Spanish
for a bit (I'm a white guy so she was pleasantly sur-
prised) and she told me about her travel plans to
go to her son's wedding--a real cute story involving
him and his high school sweetheart finding each
other after a long time being broken up.
I had recently been dumped, and said something
a bit mopey like "I wish I could find love like
that someday."
She smiled, shook her head and said "Chico, love
like that isn't just found. It's built. How many
perfect, decorated temples do you think my
ancestors stumbled across in Tikal or Tenochtitlan?
No. They found a good, level spot, maybe some
water nearby, and said 'Here. We can build
something here.' Look for a clearing in the forest,
young man. Not a hidden city."
That one will stick with me for years.
