I accidentally text a message about Mark and Lindsey
having a baby to a number I had in my phone for someone
else which now belongs to Mr. Dennis Williams and he and
his brother came by to visit us and brought the baby a gift!
What a blessing these two guys were to our family. They
were so sweet and kind to do this! You 2 are great guys and
thank you for giving to someone you didn't know! Many
blessing I pray for you. I think his brother was Derrius
Williams. Cason Knox, Lindsey, & Mark Lashley thanks you.
Please share this with anyone you know and hopefully these
guys will see. If we all only had this kind of heart.
