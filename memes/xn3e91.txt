17.4k A couple days ago someone ordered 14 mins before
closing time and wrote a note to us. I wrote one back
and gave them a free garlic bread and a couple hours
ago while working, I found out they left a review
about it :). Was pretty happy for the rest of the shift

They gave me garlic bread on the house when I was
feeling sick and wrote me a cute lil note in the delivery
box and personally I would like to give each and every
employee a little forehead kiss
Also it seems like they broil the cheese on top of the
carbonara and it makes it all crispy on top and personally
I think I might cry it was so good thank you kings
