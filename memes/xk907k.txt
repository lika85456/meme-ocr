Hi there, I think you must be
mistaking me for someone
else, my name isn't...
Ping!
DO
Oh dear, I'm so sorry to have to tell
you this but me and your father
couldn't hide it any longer. You are
adopted. We were desperate and
wanted a baby so badly that we
adopted you from China. Your birth
name is Ping. I can explain everything,
there should be two more letters
coming shortly.
